# OOP-Module1Lab1
In this lab, you will practice creating and instantiating classes. You'll be creating an application that could be used at a car dealership to organize and store information about an inventory of cars. First, you will declare a Car() Class, then instantiate objects of the Car() Class with varying properties.
